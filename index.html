                <td><p>Indus Motor Company Limited (IMC) is a joint venture between certain companies of House of <br> Habib of Pakistan, Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC), and Toyota Tsusho Corporation (TTC) of <br> Japan.  Incorporated in 1989, the Company manufactures and markets Toyota brand vehicles in
            <br> Pakistan.  These include several variants of the flagship Corolla and Yaris in the passenger car <br> segment, Hilux in the light commercial vehicle segment, Fortuner and Corolla Cross in the <br> sports utility vehicle segment.

            <br><br>

IMC’s manufacturing facility and offices are located at a <br>109.5-acre site in Port Qasim, Karachi. The product is delivered to end customers nationwide <br> through a strong network of 57 independent authorized 3S dealerships spread across the country. <br> Over 34 years, since inception, IMC has sold more than 1.1 million CKD/CBU vehicles. It has also <br> demonstrated impressive growth in terms of volumetric increase. From a modest beginning of 20 <br> vehicles per day production in 1993, the daily production capacity of the Company on double shift <br> basis increased to 288 (with overtime) units per day. This has been made possible through the <br> development of human talent embracing the “Toyota Way” of quality and lean manufacturing.</p></td>
